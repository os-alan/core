<h2 class="continued">State tab</h2>

<p>In addition to properties on the grid proper, properties on individual columns can also be set declaratively through grid state, keyed by column name.</p>

<div class="note">Although column (or row, or cell) properties can be set via <code>grid.setState</code>, this method is not appropriate when your app’s columns (or rows, or cells) are not static. When you don’t know about the columns in advance, you can set column properties by other means, <i>e.g.,</i> programmatically, or by loading and setting column properties objects, <i>etc.</i></div>

State for columns, rows, and cells may be set by dynamic properties bearing those names, which have the following shapes.

<p>For example, to set properties on column <code>prevclose</code>:</p>
<pre>{ columns: { prevclose: { key: 'value' } } }</pre>

<p>To set properties on row the fourth data row:</p>
<pre>{ rows: { data: { 3: { key: 'value' } } } }</pre>

<p>To set properties on the cell at the intersection of the fourth data row and column <code>prevclose</code>:</p>
<pre>{ cells: { data: { 3: { prevclose: { key: 'value' } } } } }</pre>

Properties cascade:
<ul>
  <li>A property set on a specific cell would override the same property set on the cell’s column.</li>
  <li>A property set on a specific column would override the same property set on the grid.</li>
  <li>A property set on the grid would override the same property set on an active theme or the properties default value.</li>
</ul>

The exact ordering of the cascade, which can also include row properties, can itself be specified by the <code>propClassLayers</code> grid property.
