  This <em>workbench</em> is for learning about Hypergrid cell formatting and editing using <em>localizers</em> and <em>cell editors</em>, respectively.
  You can also use it for actual development and testing of these objects, but be aware this app does not persist your work anywhere.
  Be careful therefore to cut &amp; paste anything you want to keep!

<h2>Interface</h2>
Before we begin the tutorial proper, letâ€™s look at the interface, which consists of three main sections:
<ol>
  <li>A Tutorial pane <em>(right)</em></li>
  <li>A live Hypergrid <em>(upper left)</em></li>
  <li>An Editor pane (four tabs) <em>(lower left)</em></li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
  Now click the <span class="button">Next &gt;</span> button <em>(above)</em> to go to the next page.
